Packaging is the process that transforms the finished wafer into a finished product by adding the necessary electrical connections and some enclosure that protects the delicate components.

## Steps

First of all the an electronic map of all dies (chips) on the wafer is created (white marking) and the after a basic electric test the defective dies are marked so that they can be discarded later. After this step the wafer is **sawn** to separate the dies from each other.  

After being separated from the wafer, the dies are bonded (attached) to the package and before fully enclosing it, it is fundamental to allow access to its electrical connections from the outside. This is done by **bonding** thin metal ($Au$ or $Al$) wires to the chip pads and connecting them to the package leads.

After that the package can be fully enclosed; the method depends on the material of the package: plastic packages are injection moulded around the die, while ceramic and metal packages use a lid and solder.

Finally a test is performed to make sure that they fully functional.

## Polycrystalline silicon (Poly)

Polycrystalline silicon can be obtained through LPCVD and is used as the gate electrode in MOS devices because it is more affordable than $Al$. It can be doped by implantation and diffusion.

The grain size depends on the deposition temperature: hotter deposition leads to larger grain structure (more similar to crystalline silicon), similarly to what happened in [[#Growth regimes|epitaxy]].
